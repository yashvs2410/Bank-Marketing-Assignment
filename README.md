# Bank-Marketing-Assignment

Welcome to the module ‘Bank Marketing Assignment’.

Businesses today use marketing campaigns to engage with their customers to improve their positions and get new customers. The advantages of marketing campaigns are as follows:

Marketing campaigns can achieve a variety of goals, such as enhancing brand awareness, introducing a new product, boosting sales or even reducing the impact of negative publicity.
Customers can be reached through various means, from distributing brochures to planning a social media campaign. One of the most popular ways to reach customers is through the telephone, whether it is fixed-line or mobile. It may also be considered telemarketing (the process of selling products or services over the telephone) since it occurs remotely in a contact centre.  
Focusing on the needs and overall satisfaction of the customer is a feature of marketing campaigns. 
 
In this module, you will be given a data set containing information about various customers, such as demographics and the latest campaign details. Can you assist the bank in making accurate predictions regarding the customer’s likelihood to continue using the campaign’s main product, the term deposit, after the campaign? 

The bank marketing case study will help you understand how to apply the concepts of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in real-life business scenarios. In this case study, you will need to analyse the data set of a marketing campaign conducted by ‘Bank of Corporate’ in 2017. Using EDA, derive an essential insight for a future marketing campaign.

 

Business Understanding
You work as a business analytics consultant at Bank of Corporate. The bank provides its customers with financial services, such as savings accounts, current accounts and debit cards. In order to increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts various marketing campaigns for its financial products, such as credit cards, term deposits and loans. These campaigns are intended for the bank’s existing customers. However, these campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank increases its overall revenues and total profit. As a bank consultant, you need to apply your knowledge of EDA to the existing data to analyse patterns and provide solution for future marketing campaigns.

In 2017, the bank conducted a telemarketing campaign for one of its financial products, ‘term deposits’, to help foster long-term relationships with its existing customers. The data set (provided below) contains information about all customers who were contacted during this year to open term deposit accounts.

 

What Are Term Deposits?
Term deposits, also called fixed deposits, are cash investments made for a period ranging from 1 month to 5 years with fixed interest rates. The fixed interest rates offered for term deposits are higher than the regular interest rates for savings accounts. At the end of the maturity period, the customers receive the total amount (the investment and the interest). Additionally, money can only be withdrawn at the end of the maturity period. If money is withdrawn before this time period, it will result in an added penalty and the customer will not receive any interest returns. This kind of investment deposit provides the required funds to the bank for lending money to corporations or individuals at a higher interest rate than what is paid to the customer.

 

Business Objectives
You aim to identify the target customers for the term deposits from the pool of the bank’s existing customers. You should also capture the key driving factors (or driver variables) behind the successful conversion of a customer, i.e., the customer opening a term deposit account with the bank. 

 

EDA
In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how customer and campaign attributes influence the successful opening of a term deposit account with the bank. The following points define customer and campaign attributes:

Customer attributes include all the information on the customer, such as bank account number, age, job, marital status, education, the cash balance in the account, information about any loan default and availing of housing loan or personal loan.
Campaign attributes include all the information related to the calls/reach outs made by the bank to the customers during the marketing campaign. The following attribute information is provided in the data set given below:
The information when the bank last approached the customer regarding any product/service, such as credit cards and loans
The total number of times the bank contacted for any product/service till the last date of the campaign
The outcome of the last reach out with the customer for any one of the products/services 
The call duration with the specific customer for opening a term deposit account
The call’s outcome that was made for opening a term deposit account with a specific customer.

Results Expected
The following pointers must be addressed before submitting the project:

Provide a step-by-step approach and details of the analyses performed to derive the insights in a PowerPoint presentation.
Identify the missing data, duplicate data, outliers and spelling inconsistencies; use the appropriate methods to deal with these issues.
Identify the possible derived columns. If required, convert any specific column to a required format for easy analysis.
Explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analyses, etc., in business terms. In addition, identify the insights that will explain how a specific variable plays an important role in influencing the customers to open the term deposit account with the bank.
Include visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation. You can choose the graphs that explain the numerical/categorical variables.
Derive the required values based on EDA of the data set for future marketing campaigns.
